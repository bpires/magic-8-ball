## About the project

<p align="left">
    This project was inspired by the one built by <a href="https://github.com/maykbrito" target="_blank">Mayk Brito</a> during the 'Maratona Explorer' event.
</p>
  <p align="left">
   The event, which took place online at Rocketseat from June 6 to 12, 2022, had a fortune-telling¬†application as its centerpiece.

## Context 

My take was to pay tribute to the iconic **magic 8-ball**, a popular device and toy invented in 1946 by **Albert C. Carter** that was used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. Albert was inspired by his mother Mary, a Cincinnati clairvoyant, who used a spirit writing device.
  
The project uses the **original 20 messages**, which include 10 affirmative responses, 5 non-committal responses, and 5 negative responses.

The Magic 8 Ball's functional component is a tube carrying a white **D20 worded dice** floating in dark coloured alcohol. When the dice floats, one of its faces is placed against the window, in a manner that its raised letters displace the dark liquid, revealing the printed message.

The pocket fortune teller device became popular in the format of a black 8 ball, used to to promote a Chicago-based billiards company in 1950. 
  
The product was later rebranded as a toy and is still available today, being considered one of the top 100 greatest toys of all-time by Time Magazine.

## Assets

The background illustration was remixed from the design of Noah Jacobus ([So You Want to Be a Product Designer](https://dribbble.com/shots/5446009-So-You-Want-to-Be-a-Product-Designer/attachments/1187731?mode=media)), using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
  
A noise Texture from [PNGKIT](https://www.pngkit.com/downpic/u2w7r5u2t4e6y3a9_24-jun-2015-noise-texture-png-transparent/) was used to create an animated grainy texture based on [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/animated-grainy-texture/) & [Red Stapler](https://redstapler.co/css-film-grain-effect/) tutorials.

The dice animations were based on the [CSS Magic 8-Ball Codepen](https://codepen.io/rockhill/pen/vYdawJ) by J. James Rockhill and [Pure CSS Magic 8-ball](https://codepen.io/finnhvman/pen/wrLPJz) by Bence Szabo.

The soundtrack is an [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)-modified loop of the sample [Gloomy Eerie Horror Piano Loop](https://samplefocus.com/samples/gloomy-eerie-horror-piano-loop), by bedsheetboy.

Icons were outsourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
