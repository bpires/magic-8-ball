This project was inspired by the one built by [Mayk Brito](https://github.com/maykbrito) during the 'Maratona Explorer' event, held from June 6-12, 2022 at Rocketseat. You can check the [original project here](https://maykrbrito.github.io/maratona-explorer-1/).

My take was to make an homage to the classic magic 8-ball, a popular device and toy invented in 1946 by Albert C. Carter, which was used for fortune-telling or seeking advice.

Albert was inspired by a spirit writing device used by his mother Mary, a Cincinnati clairvoyant.

The functional component of the Magic 8 Ball consists of a tube containing an white D20 worded dice floating in dark dyed alcohol. When the dice floats, one of its faces is pressed to the window, in a manner that its raised letters displace the blue liquid, revealing the printed message against a blue background.

The pocket fortune teller device became popular in the format of a black 8 ball, used to to promote a Chicago-based billiards company in 1950. The product was later rebranded as a toy, being sold until nowadays and is considered one of the all-time 100 greatest toys by Time Magazine.

The project uses the original 20 messages, consisting in 10 affirmative answers, 5 non-committal answers, and 5 negative answers.

The background illustration was remixed from the design of Noah Jacobus ([So You Want to Be a Product Designer](https://dribbble.com/shots/5446009-So-You-Want-to-Be-a-Product-Designer/attachments/1187731?mode=media)), using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

I applied a noise Texture from [PNGKIT](https://www.pngkit.com/downpic/u2w7r5u2t4e6y3a9_24-jun-2015-noise-texture-png-transparent/), to get an animated grainy texture based on [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/animated-grainy-texture/) & [Red Stapler](https://redstapler.co/css-film-grain-effect/) tutorials.

The soundtrack is an adapted loop of the sample [Gloomy Eerie Horror Piano Loop](https://samplefocus.com/samples/gloomy-eerie-horror-piano-loop) by bedsheetboy, modified with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

I also based animations on the [CSS Magic 8-Ball Codepen](https://codepen.io/rockhill/pen/vYdawJ) by J. James Rockhill.
